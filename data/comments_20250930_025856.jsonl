I’m sure they are stewing on the fact that practically every killer is someone who sides with the right more than the left because they can’t use it as a hit piece to go after everyone else. But if you think they will acknowledge an issue AND do something about it to help as opposed to cause more damage, we are all sadly mistaken.\n\nWhat we are also sadly mistaken about is the democrats to do a damn thing about it either. By now it would be fair to believe that the entire party would rise up and focus on fighting what mango man is doing and do everything in their power to right the ship of the American people to stop the hemorrhaging before midterms. But they won’t. They would rather let the right continue on their thirst for power and takeover than stand in the way between them and the people of the US. Status quo my ass that isn’t status quo.\n\nThe party of doing something terrible over and over is being met by the party of doing, well, nothing, with nothing more than words and not unified calls to action. The democrats should be pleading with the congressmen and women across the aisle to distance themselves from this administration and show they value country over party. But that isn’t happening.\n\nThis is just an ugly divorce of political sides shown in plain sight for the world to see.

Contention never leads to inspired solutions.”\n\n> True charity towards all men is the hallmark of peacemakers! It is imperative that we have charity in our discourse, both public and private. I thank those of you who took my previous counsel to heart. But we can still do better.\n\n> The present hostility in public dialogue and on social media is alarming. Hateful words are deadly weapons. Contention prevents the Holy Ghost from being our constant companion.\n\n> As followers of Jesus Christ, we should lead the way as peacemakers. As charity becomes part of our nature, we will lose the impulse to demean others. We will stop judging others. We will have charity for those from all walks of life. Charity towards all men is essential to our progress.

The son and daughter laughed it off. That combined with the dad's clear hatred of his kids and avoyed white supremacy beliefs I just couldn't give them views anymore. The kids are as much to blame as the parents here because they are actively platforming white supremacy and racist opinions, and not doing anything to rebut this other than laughing it off in the clips that are posted. Their kids state that they would never cut off their family because they're family and that's all they got at the end of the day, and, sure, whatever, to each their own.

The movement is branded as “anti fascism”, yet they are the most strictly fascist people in America to date. Utilizing political violence, terrorism and street justice, they navigate around the social workings of our society to terrify their political opponents into silence. Using words like “Kill all Nazis”, then branding their opponents Nazis, they send a not-so-subtle signal to their movement that an individual is to be terminated, hence Charlie’s assassination and the multiple attempts on Trump’s life.\n\nRhetoric like “if you’re against fascism, you’re Antifa” is simply a false equivalency.

That was not a prerequisite. Yeah obviously they fought against the Germans. But not every German in the German army was a convinced fascist either. Right now the US forces are led by a Republican (Trump), that does not make every American soldier a republican, and anyone who fights against them \"anti-republican\".\n\nAlso - not everyone who is against fascism is \"Antifa\". Antifa is a very loose \"group\" of people who do specific antifascist activism. That means going to protests against Nazis, ratting out Nazis to their employers, painting over racist graffiti, etc\n\nI can think that fascism is bad, but if I dont follow that up with some action, I am not part of Antifa. Which is short for \"Antifaschistische Aktion\", a far-left German resistance movement that fought (and still fight, though usually nonviolent these days) the Nazis in Germany.\n\nThe problem with Trump is that he can claim anyone is Antifa if he wants to lock them up. But that does not make everyone Antifa who does not literally endorse Hitler - there is more to it. And not every WW2 veteran is aligned with radical communist/anarchist resistance against Nazism either.\n\nI feel like this \"ww2 soliders are the original antifa\" is a very American narrative, it does not really make sense and just leads to confusion.\n\nBtw, even though there is no centralized organization, there are still many ppl who actively consider themselves part of Antifa.

So when they say things about “leftists” they can get other people on the left to agree who don’t realize that they’re actually talking about ANYONE LEFT OF MAGA. The “celebrating his death” thing is used in place of everything from “quoting charlie Kirk” to “throwing parties for the murderer.”\n\nAnd it’s the same thing. 99% of people on the left think they’re talking about the latter (throwing parties) while 99% of what people on the right are actually talking about is doing things like sharing quotes from Charlie Kirk. They, again, get the left to do their dirty work for them because of course they’re against people actually celebrating murder. They don’t realize that’s not what they’re referring to for 99.9% of the cases and by the time they figure it out the damage is done. \n\nThis is exactly why I keep telling people we are going to HAVE to go into bad faith mode and fight fire with fire.

I was one of the last people faced with the Selective Service. It was the requirement to sign up for the draft.

It was, \"Look at those fuckin hero's.\" So as a young man, I was programmed to think, our values mattered more than anything and we all love these values. So I did. Then my family started to vote against those values. Chill with it for 10 years. Hoped it would pass so I could lie to myself, despite being aware of the lie. Then the election happened. Not so chill anymore. \n\nI've had a visceral reaction and the only way to describe it is to suggest that one watches \"Born on the Fourth of July\". We are programmed to stand for something. It was generational. My family largely doesn't hold those same values. When it fails, everything collapses. For me, everything I have known and been taught to love, is no longer. If it was fine, even laudable, for me to die for the values at one point, you can never step away from those values. Either I was trash you were willing to throw away then, or who you raised me to be is on the side of something you don't value today. My loved ones won't even vote for the values I was to die for. How do I reconcile that? \n\nWe all have to live with it as we will. I just hoped the sharing of this feeling might speak to someone else. It's hard to put a finger on it.

One may protest against evil; it can be exposed and, if need be, prevented by use of force. Evil always carries within itself the germ of its own subversion in that it leaves behind in human beings at least a sense of unease. Against stupidity we are defenseless. Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict one’s prejudgment simply need not be believed — in such moments the stupid person even becomes critical — and when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. In all this the stupid person, in contrast to the malicious one, is utterly self-satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack. For that reason, greater caution is called for than with a malicious one. Never again will we try to persuade the stupid person with reasons, for it is senseless and dangerous.\"", "created_utc": "2025-09-29T22:12:44Z", "score": 3, "depth": 3, "retrieved_at": "2025-09-30T03:00:25Z"}

I kindly tried to explain that we were very early adopters on AirBnb because as much as I'd rather just use a hotel, they've gotten to expensive for what we get, theres no truly nice service anymore, and they've added too many hidden fees that make my stay double from what I'm led to believe. I said if you want me to stay at a hotel I'll gladly do it if you stop trying to nickel and dime me, and just give me a nice clean stay at the price I see when I book the room. \n\nWell he pivoted to what the company is doing to win back the trendy airbnb folks. \"Those younger kids don't want room service anymore. They'd rather use that postmates thing to get burgers and fries. So....we're revamping the menu and saving food costs by getting burgers and fries that can be made super fast and brought to the room.\" I don't think he wanted to listen to me kindly explain that microwaved burgers and fries aren't the answer. \n\nThey're out of touch. However I've met plenty of hotel General Managers and staff who are very much in touch and actually give a fuck about giving a great stay.", "created_utc": "2025-09-29T20:40:29Z", "score": 5, "depth": 1, "retrieved_at": "2025-09-30T03:00:32Z"}

And Gaza loses 10-15% of its land mass? Israelis want that zone for security - to prevent another October 7 - and some people say that unless the other side loses territory, it's not counted as a loss. In Lebanon in 2005, Israel withdrew as part of an agreement with Hezbollah that did not involve a loss of territory, and much of the Arab world convinced itself that Hezbollah won. Israel's only goal in southern Lebanon was peace on the northern border of Israel and the period 2005-2023 was the most peaceful period on the Lebanese border. It was therefore hard for Israel to reinvade simply because Hezbollah immediately violated the agreement and moved south of the Litani river. While the Hezbollah move to the south was a violation of the agreement (predicated on a now obvious legalistic ruse about \"Shebba Farms\" being in Lebanon, which is now agreed to be in Syria (but occupied by Israel) by everyone on the Arab side now that Assad is gone and Syria is not playing along), Israel achieved its main objective - quiet - and Hezbollah understood that unless they actually opened fire, Israel would stay out of Lebanon regardless of violations of the 2005 agreement. Until 2023, this worked. But some Israelis say that failing to take land gives people on the Arab side the wrong idea. Everyone knows Israel won in 1967 because they took land and still have it. If Israel takes some piece of Gaza and never gives it back - like the buffer zone - not only does that improve Israeli security, it can act as a deterrent to starting a war. Just as Hamas will fudge the \"disarmament\" of the agreement and not comply (and they might get away with it) - if they agree - Israel will fudge the idea of the buffer zone such that they can claim the territory as a permanment IDF military zone that is tacitly agreed to by the Arab states - a message: how do you like that Palestinians? We will take your land, and the Arabs will let us, so don't start more wars against us. I would be surprised if Israel withdrew from the buffer ever or if Hamas ever really disarmed.\n\nIn the history of this conflict, temporary cease-fire lines are the closest thing to an agreed border that has emerged. The famous \"green line\" was just where the armies were at the end of fighting in 1948-49. The lines that define Gaza are based on where Egyptian forces were when the guns fell silent. At times, the idea that any Israeli settlement on the Arab side of the green line is an illegal settlement and that the green line defines the legal area of \"Israel proper\" versus illegally occupied areas in which there can be no legal settlement. As Israelis are very aware, in 1948, the Egyptians and Jordanians explicitly demanded that the cease-fire negotiations leading to the green line were NOT final status borders. They insisted on low-ranking officers making the agreement and were so dismissive of the green line that they let Israel take the map home with the green pen marks on it - so where the green line exactly is, only Israel really knows, the Arabs don't have a copy from the time that is precise. Even Barack Obama spoke as if there were some legal meaning to the green line. Israelis, however, say, \"Hold on. You (Arabs) said this line was a military ceasefire line with no further meaning when you thought you could come back and wipe us out. But since we won round two, all of a sudden this meaningless line you were dissing in 48 is the real border...\" This experience of a temporary line becoming a defining legal border in many people's minds is why Ehud Barack never even drew a map on the back of an envelope at Camp David with Yassir Arafat and Bill Clinton. Having see this green line thing go down, he was like, \"Nope. The minute I draw a line on a napkin and show it to Yassir Arafat, they PLO will demand we withdraw to the line on the napkin when they refuse to sign this agreement and we have to push them further into enclaves.\" \n\nGaza is much clearer than the West Bank and the only \"temporary\" line on this map on this post that could, if this agreement gets halfway off the ground, become a de facto border is the buffer zone. The Palestinians probably know that the only line the Israelis want is the buffer zone. Israel will stick to the agreement for the first stages but will balk at the point when they are supposed to withdraw from that last bit.", "created_utc": "2025-09-30T01:21:38Z", "score": 0, "depth": 0, "retrieved_at": "2025-09-30T03:00:45Z"}

However, these cases often result in the officer being granted immunity and not facing civil or criminal penalties. Here are notable cases where an armed citizen was involved in a deadly encounter with police:\n\n* **Andrew Scott (2012):** When officers, who were searching for another suspect, came to his Leesburg, Florida, apartment, Scott opened his door while holding a handgun. When the officers fired and killed Scott, his girlfriend, Miranda Mauck, claimed he was acting within his Second Amendment right to use a firearm for home self-defense. A federal appeals court granted qualified immunity to the officer who shot Scott, reasoning that the officer was legally justified to use deadly force because Scott was holding a gun.\n* **Emantic \"EJ\" Bradford Jr. (2018):** Following a shooting at an Alabama mall, police officers shot and killed Bradford, a licensed gun owner who was trying to stop the initial shooter. One of the officers shot Bradford without warning, mistakenly believing he was the suspect. A federal appeals court later upheld a lower court's decision to grant immunity to the officer.\n* **Philando Castile (2016):** Castile was shot and killed by a police officer in Minnesota after informing the officer that he was a licensed gun owner and had a firearm in the car. The officer claimed self-defense, though gun rights advocates noted that Castile followed recommended procedures for announcing a firearm. The officer was acquitted of all charges. ", "created_utc": "2025-09-29T23:49:00Z", "score": 2, "depth": 1, "retrieved_at": "2025-09-30T03:00:52Z"}

Officer got let go, retired on police pension. Mom was a dope fiend and got paid off to bury it.\n\nIdgaf what anyone got to say. Police never have and never will control their people. I’m not saying they all bad, there’s definitely at least one good cop in every city. They simply learned how to control the public perception, and that’s why people think they gotten better. But in reality, they still stuck back in the Gang Busters era.", "created_utc": "2025-09-29T22:24:24Z", "score": 1, "depth": 0, "retrieved_at": "2025-09-30T03:00:58Z"}

Upon the deputies’ arrival, it was learned that an off-duty deputy was involved in the incident in the neighborhood where he resides. \n \nShortly after the incident, the deputy was suspended without pay. He was relieved of his credentials, badge, Sheriff’s Office issued weapons, and equipment by a Command Staff member who responded to the scene. \n \nDeputies are held to a higher standard, as they must abide by all BCSO policies and procedures, both on and off duty. The Internal Affairs Investigation is an administrative investigation that could take some time to complete, with multiple people needing to be interviewed.  \n \nThe Sheriff’s Office is asking for the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) to investigate this incident for any possible criminal violations. Any results of a SLED criminal investigation would be forwarded to the 14th Circuit Solicitor’s Office for review.  \n \nIt is important to understand that while our office is conducting an administrative investigation, any criminal investigation being conducted by SLED will be conducted as a parallel investigation in accordance with the standards set forth by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA). \n \nWe appreciate any concerns and comments involving this case. In an effort to allow the investigations to be conducted, we will not be responding to any further questions regarding this incident at this time.  \n \nWe would appreciate it if anyone has any information to provide, that they cooperate with both our agency and SLED if required during this investigation.    \n \nAt a future point in time, the deputy’s identity will be released.\"", "created_utc": "2025-09-29T23:39:00Z", "score": 1, "depth": 0, "retrieved_at": "2025-09-30T03:00:58Z"}

Smartphones weren't really big then, so we would all go home and tell our parents and they'd be like \"WHAT? NO THE POLICE ARE THERE TO HELP YOU, THEY WOULDN'T DO THAT.\" Once iPhones became a thing, we got A LOT of video of police abusing students from about 2015 to today. Some of the officers got disciplined, but then it became a political thing for local politicians to \"allow the police to do their jobs.\" So yeah, this type of thing has been happening all over the south, and still happens today.

It feels silly to say this now but when the Simpsons first came out, it was the edgy, controversial show that the old fogies hated and everyone under 40 fell in love with for its rebellious spirit.  It was designed intentionally to go against the wholesome 80s sitcoms like Full House.  They wanted it to, at its barest, parallel the 80s sitcom (the brainy child, the brat, the dopey father, and the overworked mother) but take the tropes and twist them into something objectionable.  It's why Homer strangling Bart is so commonplace in the early seasons.  He still loves his son and has many moments of showing how much he cares for Bart, but he's also going to cross the line and strangle him.  During its early years, there was such an uproar regarding the Simpsons that there were literal Congressional discussions talking about banning it.  \n\nBut as the capitalist machine churned and Simpsons continued to explode in popularity, other shows starting popping up with similarly edgy content, or pushing it even further in the case of something like South Park.  But regardless of how we perceived Simpsons on being good or bad, it was always designed to maintain a grounded, semi-realistic take on an 80s sitcom.  After so many seasons though, the need for that died and they started getting weird (thankfully).

Of course, their tournies include big names like Capcom, ArcSystemWorks, SNK, sega, Netherrealm Studios, Bandai-Namco, Sony, who all also drop industry-shaking news there.

Abraham Lincoln is said to have greeted her with the words, “So you’re the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war.”\n\nWhen Picasso painted Guernica, it carried the weight of Spain’s tragedy to the entire world and turned the horrors of war into a universal cry for peace.\n\nWhen Bob Dylan wrote protest songs, they became the soundtrack of the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War resistance.\n\nWhen Nina Simone performed Mississippi Goddam, she broke the silence on racial terror and forced America to listen.\n\nWhen Elvis Presley first appeared on national TV, the fusion of Black rhythm and blues with white mainstream audiences shook segregation at its cultural core.\n\nWhen The Beatles arrived in America, they brought a counterculture that questioned war, politics, and the establishment.\n\nWhen N.W.A. shouted F** tha Police*, they forced the world to confront police brutality\n\nSaudi, like many places, still has a long way to go when it comes to free expression and equal rights. But the fact that the country is opening its doors to global entertainment is a sign of progress.\n\nArt carries empathy. \n\nArt changes perspective. \n\nArt breaks systems. \n\nLet artists just be artists again and not players in your own personal political agendas. ", "created_utc": "2025-09-30T02:12:41Z", "score": 1, "depth": 0, "retrieved_at": "2025-09-30T03:01:13Z"}
